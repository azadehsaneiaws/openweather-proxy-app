# openweather-proxy-app
A full-stack weather application that proxies requests to the OpenWeatherMap API using a secure .NET 8 Web API backend with rate limiting and a React + TypeScript frontend for user interaction. The backend enforces API key authentication and limits each key to 5 requests per hour, ensuring secure and controlled access.
